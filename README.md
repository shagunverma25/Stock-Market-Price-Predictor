# Stock-Market-Price-Predictor
The Stock Market Price Prediction project is a ML based web application that uses historical stock data to predict future stock prices. The app utilizes a LSTM model, a type of RNN, to make accurate predictions on stock price trends. Users can input a stock symbol, view the historical data, and compare the actual prices with predicted values over time.

This project provides an easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit and integrates data from yFinance for real-time stock data retrieval.

Technologies Used:
Python,
Keras (for building and training the LSTM model),
Streamlit (for creating the interactive web app),
yFinance (for fetching stock data),
Scikit-learn (for data scaling),
Matplotlib (for plotting graphs and visualizations)
